A human brain is collection of neurons that are connected to each other by synapses and electrical pulses travel between.  This consist of a input, say reading a book and the neural network will respond by firing up the relevent neruanons that deal reading text and makes sense of the text (the thinking process) and giving a output, e.g. giving a sumarry of the text read.  An artificial neural network (ann) is a collection of artificial neurons that are connected to each other in a particular archtechure that exists on a computer.  A example ANN arcitecture could be a  CNN (converlutiohn neural network) or a RNN (Recurrent Neural Network ) or a combination of these layers and many others. In the notebooks case, the model will take in a sequences of pixels (an image) and output a sequence of pixels (an image) using sequential CNNs.\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":184,"metadata":{},"outputs":[{"name":"stderr","output_type":"stream","text":["'[\"Human neural network vs artificial neural network\"]' is not recognized as an internal or external command,\n","operable program or batch file.\n"]}],"source":["![\"Human neural network vs artificial neural network\"](\"https://clevertap.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Neural_Network_Brain_Mimic.jpeg\")"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["\n","\n","The archtechure of the model is a type of convolutional neural network (CNN) and it consists of five main blocks, each containing a sequence of layers.\n","\n","1.

A loss function is a measure between the predicted output and the actual output. In simple terms the closer these two are the better the model will perform, you will get what you expect from the model.  The weights are updated by using the gradient of the loss function.  The gradient is the slope of the loss function.  It can be thought of as the direction the weights should be updated.  If the gradient is positive then the weights should be increased.  If the gradient is negative then the weights should be decreased.  If the weights are increased/descreesed by too much then the model will over shoot and not get you closer to the actual output.  The aim of the optimizer is to get to the smallest loss possible in the quickest amount of time or with the least amount of processing power."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["## Adam optimizer with annealing learning rate"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["The aim of this blog is to show how to use the Adam optimizer with annealing learning rate.
