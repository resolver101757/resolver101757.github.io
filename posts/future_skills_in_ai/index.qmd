# Overview

[Manufacturing is a key sector for the UK economy, accounting for 10% of GDP and 44% of exports, the UK is the 8th largest exporter in the world][uk manufacturing facts 2023]. Manufacturing didnt use to be about computing technology. It was about the materials and the processes.  Computing and data is now at the centre and key to the future of manufacturing.  This article will explore the impact of AI on manufacturing jobs, and how this will affect the workforce. It will also look at what roles will be created in the future, and how these roles will will help the uk manufacturing sector.  This will indicate how manufacturing will look in the future.

# Evolution of manufacturing : 3rd, 4th, 5th industrial revolutions


![picture of industrial revolutions](./Industry5.jpg)

You can see from the image above,computers started to appear in:

The **3rd industrial revolution** but there were lots of companies that didnt have IT systems and when they did, they were not joined up.  The IT systems were maybe stock control, accounting, or an ERP system and PLC's to automate machines that were previously manual. 

The **4th industrial revolution** the IT systems are more joined up and the machines and parts and factories make use of IOT (internet of things) systems.  All this allows for real-time data exchange and monitoring. This connectivity facilitates more efficient operations, predictive maintenance, and improved decision-making based on comprehensive data analysis.  This is where most manufacturing companies are now but some are remecent to change and are still in the 3rd industrial revolution.

The **5th industrial revolution** While still largely conceptual and not universally recognized as a distinct phase, the idea of a fifth industrial revolution often revolves around the integration of advanced technologies like AI and robotics into the manufacturing process. This could lead to even greater automation, with AI making complex decisions and managing processes. The focus is not just on efficiency and productivity but also on personalization and sustainability. The impact on economies and workforces would be significant, as it would necessitate a shift in skills and roles.


# The Current State of AI in Manufacturing

AI is already being used in manufacturing, but it's still in its infancy. The majority of AI applications in manufacturing are focused on improving efficiency and productivity. This includes predictive maintenance, supply chain optimization, and process automation. However, there are also applications in areas like quality control, worker safety, and customer service. The impact of AI on manufacturing is expected to grow significantly in the coming years, with the global market for [AI in manufacturing projected to reach $16.7 billion by 2026][AI in manufacturing projections].

## Personal Experience: AI's Impact on My Workflow

As a IT worker in manufacturing, my work flow has change due to the advancements in AI. I'm a ahead of the rest of the business in terms of using AI to improve my workflow and results it gives to the business.  

I use to speak to the the people in business (my customers), understanding their/the businesses requirements, and then building a solution and iterate between the two and maybe use a 3rd party for extra resources to finish the solution in a quicker time.

The process has now changed, I still need to speak to people in the business but I use AI and data science skills and present the information from the various information systems and unstructured systems and present that to the business and use that to squeeze out the information to make decisions or gain further requirements.

When a solution is required, I'm now using AI to help me build the solution in record time and with better quality, giving the business a better return on their investment in me, affectivly increasing my worth.  The AI models I'm using are general purpose models that have been trained on lots of data but im using them to build unique products and solutions that are a fit for our business.  Building solutions using AI and building on existing foundation AI models is the future of manufacturing.

Other people in the business will improve their work flow by using generalized AI models and systems to help them make decisions and automate processes their own processes. They will also get the benefit of the work I'm doing (IT department), as I am be able to build solutions to improve their processes.

This will free up their time to do more value added work.  This will increase their worth to the business.  This will increase the UK economy.  This will increase the UK productivity.


## The Economics of AI in Manufacturing

Graphics cards (tensor procceses) are the hardware that compute AI models.  The sale of these cards gives a great insight into the future demand of AI, it's one of the limiting factors in more models and end users using those models.  GPU demand is outstripping supply and is likley to do for a long time.  Companies are racing to train the latest models, updating existing models and providing compute for inference (querying models for results).  All of this requires more GPU's.  Here's some stats from [GPU economics] (https://www.latent.space/p/semianalysis)
 on the growth of GPU's:

- NVIDIA is forecasted to sell over 3 million GPUs next year, about 3x their 2023 sales of about 1 million H100s.
- AMD is forecasting $2B of sales for their new MI300X datacenter GPU. They are also indirectly getting a boost from the work that companies like Modular and tiny are doing in making it easier to actually use these chips (will ROCm ever catch up?).
- Google’s TPUv5 supply is going to increase rapidly going into 2024.
- Microsoft just announced Maia 100, a new AI accelerator built “with feedback” from OpenAI.
and much more.

# Software Evolution: From 1.0 to 3.0 in Manufacturing

Software is changing, the pace of change is accelerating due to AI.  The future of software is going to be very different to the past. Software is at the heart of manufacturing, it's used to control the machines, it's used to control the processes, it's used to control the supply chain, it's used to understand the business and help control the business.  Manufactures leadership and employees need to be aware of these changes and secondly, they are going to need to adapt to this change.  They need to realise that this change is key to the 4th and 5th industrial revolutions mentioned above and their future success. The manufactures that adapt the quickest will be the ones that profit and grow. The manufactures that don't adapt will be left behind.  Now a little about the software evolution.

- Software 1.0: Hand-coded software with conditional logic, loops, etc.

The deterministic nature of Software 1.0 made it highly reliable and predictable, which was crucial for manufacturing processes where precision and consistency were non-negotiable. However, this method had its limitations. It was labor-intensive and less adaptable, requiring substantial human effort for updates and modifications.

- Software 2.0: Machine learning models like neural nets trained on data

Software 2.0 signifies a paradigm shift towards machine learning models, particularly neural networks. Instead of manually programming every possible outcome, this era focused on training models on large datasets. These models could then learn patterns, make decisions, and adapt to new data, making them more flexible than their predecessors.

- Software 3.0: Using large pre-trained foundation models without needing to collect/label training data

Software 3.0 is where the future begins to unfold, characterized by the use of large, pre-trained foundation models. These AI models, having been trained on extensive, diverse datasets, can be fine-tuned for specific tasks, drastically reducing the need for new data collection and labeling.

The will be a transition between software 2 and 3. We're in a weird space where alot of people/companies are still in software 1.0 and trying out features from software 2.0. I can see some people/companies skipping directly to software 3.

## The Future of Manufacturing Software

In the manufacturing sector, Software 3.0 opens up new horizons. It allows for greater customization, efficiency in processes, and enhanced predictive capabilities for maintenance and supply chain management. The integration of AI with IoT and robotics leads to smarter, more connected factories.

## How AI change my work flow

A quick dive into how AI has changed my role as a IT worker in manufacturing.  This will give a insight on what changes have already happened and what the future will look like.  My work flow and the tools i used have changed significantly, I'm ahead of the rest of the business in terms of using AI to improve my workflow and the results it gives to the business.

I use to speak to the the people in business (my customers), understanding their/the businesses requirements, and then building a solution and iterate between the two and maybe use a 3rd party for extra help in find/building a solution too.

The process has now changed, I still need to speak to people in the business but I'm using AI and data science skills a lot more understand problem, querying information systems and unstructured systems to present that to the business.  This helps squeeze out the the problem to help make better decisions or refine the problem so we know we are spending time on the right problems.  Its not that we couldnt do this before, the task to do this were much more time consuming and required more people to do this.  Now I can do this myself, I can do this in a fraction of the time and I can do this with more accuracy.

When a solution is required, I'm now using AI to help me build the solution in record time and with better quality, giving the business a better return on their investment in me, affectivily increasing my worth.  The AI models I'm using are general purpose models that have been trained on lots of data, I'm leveraging these tools to build unique products and solutions that are benefit business.  

Other humans in the business will also improve their work flow by using generalized AI models and systems to help them make decisions and automate their own processes. They will also get the benefit of the work I'm doing (IT department), as I am be able to build solutions to improve their processes.

This will free up their time to do more value added work.  This will increase their worth to the business.  Thinking bigger, this will increase the UK productivity and drive down cost for our customers and increase our competitiveness in the global market.

## Ecomonics of AI 

Graphics cards (tensor procceses) are the hardware that compute AI models.  The sale of these cards gives a great insight into the future of AI, its one of the limiting factors in producing more AI inference (results) from AI models.  GPU demand is outstripping supply and is likley to do for a long time.  Companies are racing to train the latest models, fine tuning existing models and providing compute for inference (querying models for results).  All of this requires more GPU's.

and much more.

**Democratizing AI**

This new wave democratizes access to advanced machine learning technologies, making it feasible for more organizations to leverage AI for their specific needs. It signifies a move towards more intelligent, automated, and efficient manufacturing processes.

# What will new AI roles look like 

## Over view 

It use to be that you needed expert maths skills and computer science skills to be able to build and train models.  You would need to know how to prepare data, how to train models, how to evaluate models, how to deploy models, how to monitor models, how to retrain models, how to update models how to use models. you would need indeptch knowledge of them all or more likely, be in a team where say, you would have data data prepartion expert, an expert in models for the type of data, and architecture to be able to comunicate between them all and many more. 

The most talked about foundation model is chatgpt. Its a chatbot inferface where you ask questions (prompt) and it will give you an answer.  There are other less known models where you just ask what you want in text and it return in other forms such as images, text, video, audio, 3d modles.  Anyone who can use a computer can use these models. All it takes is understanding what models are available, what they do for you and how to get the best outputs for your inputs.

For more advance users/developers there are more specific models for say producing code from prompts written in english like copilot.  There are over 15,000 off the shelf models from huggingface raning from nlp, multimodel, computer vision, speech processing and many more.  All these models have there weights release which means that they can be use as is or customize (fine tuned) to your own organizational needs.  There are datasets ready to be used to train Neural network and spaces to allow you to use the models.   This is where things start to get interesting.

Understanding the architecture of these models - their layers and structure - is crucial. The ability to employ a pre-trained model bypasses the need for extensive data collection and training, accelerating the deployment process.

Putting these foundation models into production varies in complexity. It can be as simple as calling an API where no knowledge of infrastrucure is required.  Or as intricate as running the models locally, serving high-volume predictions. Running locally and managing demands requires a keen understanding of GPU utilization, batching, and infrastructure expertise.

The emergence of AI engineers is reshaping the landscape of development. AI is becoming increasingly accessible to traditional software engineers, blurring the lines between machine learning engineers and AI engineers. The latter focuses on consuming foundation model APIs rather than building models from scratch.

This shift has economic implications. The demand for AI far exceeds the supply of machine learning experts. Consequently, AI engineers are evolving from software engineers who acquire these specialized skills.

The AI engineering stack is defined by systems of reasoning and retrieval-augmented generation stacks. These connect models to diverse data sources, broadening the scope of application.

AI UX is expanding beyond chatbots, introducing new modalities and interfaces. Building products with these foundation models requires a focus on delivering unique value, solving customer problems, and building trust.

However, there's a balance to be struck. While some skepticism towards AI is healthy, there's also a tendency to unfairly blame AI for shortcomings. The hype generated by media and industry creators sets high expectations. It's essential for AI engineers to remain grounded in real customer needs.

The impact of AI applications is already being felt in various sectors, demonstrating the positive influence of these technologies. For AI engineers, this era represents an unprecedented opportunity to innovate, explore, and shape the future of industries 4.0 and 5.0. Their role is not just about technical proficiency, but also about envisioning and realizing the potential of AI to transform industries and improve lives.
