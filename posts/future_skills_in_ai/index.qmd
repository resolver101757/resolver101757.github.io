# Overview

[Manufacturing is a key sector for the UK economy, accounting for 10% of GDP and 44% of exports, the UK is the 8th largest exporter in the world][uk manufacturing facts 2023]. Manufacturing didnt use to be about computing technology. It was about the materials and the processes.  Computing and data is now at the centre and key to the future of manufacturing.  This article will explore the impact of AI on manufacturing jobs, and how this will affect the workforce. It will also look at what roles will be created in the future, and how these roles will  help the UK manufacturing sector.  This will indicate how manufacturing will look in the future.

# Evolution of manufacturing : 3rd, 4th, 5th industrial revolutions


![picture of industrial revolutions](./Industry5.jpg)

You can see from the image above, computers started to appear in:

The **3rd industrial revolution** but there were lots of companies that didnt have IT systems and when they did, they were not joined up.  The IT systems were maybe stock control, accounting, or an ERP system and PLC's to automate machines that were previously manual. 

The **4th industrial revolution** the IT systems are more joined up and the machines and parts and factories make use of IOT (internet of things) systems.  All this allows for real-time data exchange and monitoring. This connectivity facilitates more efficient operations, predictive maintenance, and improved decision-making based on comprehensive data analysis.  This is where most manufacturing companies are now but some are resistant to change and are still in the 3rd industrial revolution.

The **5th industrial revolution** While still largely conceptual and not universally recognized as a distinct phase, the idea of a fifth industrial revolution often revolves around the integration of advanced technologies like AI and robotics into the manufacturing process. This could lead to even greater automation, with AI making complex decisions and managing processes. The focus is not just on efficiency and productivity but also on personalization and sustainability. The impact on economies and workforces would be significant, as it would necessitate a shift in skills and roles.


# The Current State of AI in Manufacturing

AI is already being used in manufacturing, but it's still in its infancy. The majority of AI applications in manufacturing are focused on improving efficiency and productivity. This includes predictive maintenance, supply chain optimization, and process automation. There are a lot of classification models for quality but more growth will be on the generative models.  The impact of AI on manufacturing is expected to grow significantly in the coming years, with the global market for [AI in manufacturing projected to reach $16.7 billion by 2026][AI in manufacturing projections].

## Personal Experience: AI's Impact on My Workflow

As a IT worker in manufacturing, my work flow has change due to the advancements in AI. I'm a ahead of the rest of the business in terms of using AI to improve my workflow and results it gives to the business.

I use to speak to the people in business (my customers), understanding their/the businesses requirements, and then building a solution and iterate between the two and maybe use a 3rd party for extra resources to finish the solution in a quicker time.

The approach I use has evolved. While I still communicate with colleagues, I now employ AI and data science techniques to extract and organize information from various structured and unstructured systems. This allows me to present data to the business in a more efficient and effective manner. Prior to recent technological advancements, managing this process alone wouldn't have been cost-effective. Currently, I leverage these tools to distil information, which aids in making decisions or uncovering additional insights and requirements.

When a solution is required, I'm now using AI to help me build the solution in record time and with better quality, giving the business a better return on their investment in me, effectivly increasing my worth.  The AI models I'm using are general purpose models that have been trained on lots of data but im using them to build unique products and solutions that are a fit for our business.  Building solutions using AI and building on existing foundation AI models is the future of manufacturing.

Other people in the business will improve their work flow by using generalized AI models and systems to help them make decisions and automate processes their own processes. They will also get the benefit of the work I'm doing (IT department), as I am be able to build solutions to improve their processes.

This will free up their time to do more value added work.  This will increase their worth to the business.  This will increase the UK economy.  This will increase the UK productivity.


## The Economics of AI in Manufacturing

Graphics cards (tensor proceses) are the hardware that compute AI models.  The sale of these cards gives a great insight into the future demand of AI, it's one of the limiting factors in more models and end users using those models.  GPU demand is outstripping supply and is likley to do for a long time.  Companies are racing to train the latest models, updating existing models and providing compute for inference (querying models for results).  All of this requires more GPU's.  Here's some stats from [GPU economics] (https://www.latent.space/p/semianalysis)
 on the growth of GPU's:

- NVIDIA is forecasted to sell over 3 million GPUs next year, about 3x their 2023 sales of about 1 million H100s.
- AMD is forecasting $2B of sales for their new MI300X datacenter GPU. They are also indirectly getting a boost from the work that companies like Modular and tiny are doing in making it easier to actually use these chips (will ROCm ever catch up?).
- Google’s TPUv5 supply is going to increase rapidly going into 2024.
- Microsoft just announced Maia 100, a new AI accelerator built “with feedback” from OpenAI.
and much more.

Having more compute will increase competition and drive down prices.  This will allow more companies to use AI and more people to use AI.  This will increase the demand for AI and the demand for AI workers.

# Software Evolution: From 1.0 to 3.0 in Manufacturing

Software is changing, the pace of change is accelerating due to AI.  The future of software is going to be very different to the past. Software is at the heart of manufacturing, it's used to control the machines, it's used to control the processes, it's used to control the supply chain, it's used to understand the business and help control the business.  Manufactures leadership and employees need to be aware of these changes and secondly, they are going to need to adapt to this change.  They need to realise that this change is key to the 4th and 5th industrial revolutions mentioned above and their future success. The manufactures that adapt the quickest will be the ones that profit and grow. The manufactures that don't adapt will be left behind.  Now a little about the software evolution.

- Software 1.0: Hand-coded software with conditional logic, loops, etc.

The deterministic nature of Software 1.0 made it highly reliable and predictable, which was crucial for manufacturing processes where precision and consistency were non-negotiable. However, this method had its limitations. It was labor-intensive and less adaptable, requiring substantial human effort for updates and modifications.

- Software 2.0: Machine learning models like neural nets trained on data

Software 2.0 signifies a paradigm shift towards machine learning models, particularly neural networks. Instead of manually programming every possible outcome, this era focused on training models on large datasets. These models could then learn patterns, make decisions, and adapt to new data, making them more flexible than their predecessors.

- Software 3.0: Using large pre-trained foundation models without needing to collect/label training data

Software 3.0 is where the future begins to unfold, characterized by the use of large, pre-trained foundation models. These AI models, having been trained on extensive, diverse datasets, can be fine-tuned for specific tasks, drastically reducing the need for new data collection and labeling.

There will be a transition between software 2 and 3. We're in a weird space where alot of people/companies are still in software 1.0 and trying out features from software 2.0 but also using 3.0 on occasional. i think all 3 will exist for a long time but will be seeing more growth in software 2.0 and especially 3.0.


## The Future of Manufacturing Software

In the manufacturing sector, Software 3.0 opens up new horizons. It allows for greater customization, efficiency in processes, and enhanced predictive capabilities for maintenance and supply chain management. The integration of AI with IoT and robotics leads to smarter, more connected factories.  

## Democratization of Advanced Machine Learning Technologies in Manufacturing

The democratization of AI is a key driver of this evolution. The availability of foundation models and the ease of use of AI platforms are lowering the barrier to entry. This is enabling more people to leverage AI in their work, including those without extensive data science expertise. The result is a shift in the role of software engineers, from building models to consuming them. This is the rise of the AI engineer.

# What will new AI roles look like 

## Over view 

It used to be that you needed expert maths skills, data science and coding skills to be able to build and train models and then a lot of experience in all of the roles.  You would need to know how to prepare data, how to train models, how to evaluate models, how to deploy models, how to monitor models, how to retrain models, how to update models, how to use models. You would need in depth knowledge of them all or more likely, be in a team where have, a data preparation expert, an expert in models for the different types of data, and architecture to be able to communicate between these roles and many more roles.   A lot of the tooling improvements have enabled this to be done by one person or a very small team depending on how big the project is.

The most talked about model is ChatGPT. It’s a chatbot interface where you ask questions (prompt) and it will give you an answer.  There are other less known models where you just ask what you want in text and it return in other forms such as images, text, video, audio, 3d models.  Anyone who can use a computer can use these models. All it takes is understanding what models are available, what they do for you and how to get the best outputs for your inputs.  This will be a key skill to have.

For more advance users/developers there are more specific solutions for producing code within a development environment like Microsoft copilot offers.  There are over 15,000 off the shelf models from hugging face ranging from nlp, multimodal, computer vision, speech processing and many more.  All these models have their weights release which means that they can be use as is or customize (fine-tuned) to your own organizational needs, no need to start from scratch.  On hugging face, there are datasets ready to be used to train Neural network and spaces to allow you to use the models.   This is where things start to get interesting.

## Enter the AI engieer,

In the rapidly evolving landscapes of Industry 4.0 and 5.0, the role of the AI engineer emerges as a pivotal element. This role is defined by a deep understanding of the problem domain, comprehensive knowledge of AI models and ecosystems, and the ability to apply this expertise to deliver tangible business outcomes.

Foundation models like GPT-3/4, Claude, and Whisper, signify a shift in the AI paradigm. These models are accessible off-the-shelf via APIs, offering a streamlined path to implementation. Understanding the architecture of these models - their layers and structure - is crucial. The ability to employ a pre-trained model bypasses the need for extensive data collection and training, accelerating the deployment process.

Putting these foundation models into production varies in complexity. It can be as simple as calling an API where no knowledge of infrastrucure is required.  Or as intricate as running the models locally, serving high-volume predictions. Running locally and managing demands requires a keen understanding of GPU utilization, batching, and infrastructure expertise.

The emergence of AI engineers is reshaping the landscape of development. AI is becoming increasingly accessible to traditional software engineers, blurring the lines between machine learning engineers and AI engineers. The latter focuses more on consuming foundation model APIs and the former more on building models from scratch.

This shift has economic implications. The demand for AI far exceeds the supply of machine learning experts. Consequently, AI engineers are evolving from software engineers who acquire these specialized skills.

The AI engineering stack is defined by systems of reasoning and retrieval-augmented generation stacks. These connect models to diverse data sources, broadening the scope of application.

AI UX is expanding beyond chatbots, introducing new modalities and interfaces. Building products with these foundation models requires a focus on delivering unique value, solving customer problems, and building trust.

However, there's a balance to be struck. While some scepticism towards AI is healthy, there's also a tendency to unfairly blame AI for shortcomings. The hype generated by media and industry creators sets high expectations. It's essential for AI engineers to remain grounded in real customer needs.

The impact of AI applications is already being felt in various sectors, demonstrating the positive influence of these technologies. For AI engineers, this era represents an unprecedented opportunity to innovate, explore, and shape the future of industries 4.0 and 5.0. Their role is not just about technical proficiency, but also about envisioning and realizing the potential of AI to transform industries and improve lives.
